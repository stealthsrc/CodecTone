# CodecTone

CodecTone converts, compresses, and cuts audio files locally on Windows with FFmpeg. It provides a WPF interface and a command-line executable. Media processing does not use cloud storage or telemetry.

Repository: [github.com/stealthsrc/CodecTone](https://github.com/stealthsrc/CodecTone)

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 or newer, x64.
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime for the lightweight GUI build.
- .NET SDK 8.0.420 to build or test the source.
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on `PATH`, or network access for the optional managed FFmpeg installation.

CodecTone can install FFmpeg 9.0.1 in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AudioConverter\runtime\ffmpeg`. The installer verifies the pinned SHA-256 before extracting `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.

## Install

Clone and build the project:

```console
git clone https://github.com/stealthsrc/CodecTone.git
cd CodecTone
build_executable.bat
```

The build produces:

```text
release\final\CodecTone.exe
release\final\CodecTone-Standalone.exe
release\cli\CodecTone.Cli.exe
```

`CodecTone.exe` requires the .NET 8 Desktop Runtime. `CodecTone-Standalone.exe` includes the runtime. Double-click `launch_audio_converter.bat` to select the appropriate GUI build automatically.

## Usage

The GUI contains four workspaces:

- **CONVERT** processes one file or a non-recursive folder batch.
- **CUT AUDIO** selects a waveform range, applies fades, previews it, and exports it.
- **COMPRESS AUDIO** uses quality profiles or a total-size budget and scans folders recursively.
- **REMIX AUDIO** applies twelve editable presets or an ordered effect rack to one song and edits its metadata.
- **ABOUT** explains the local processing pipeline and links to the maintainer profile.

Supported source formats are MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, AAC, and M4A. Compression destinations exclude WAV because it generally does not reduce file size.

Convert FLAC to MP3 at 320 kbit/s:

```console
release\cli\CodecTone.Cli.exe "music\track.flac" --format mp3 --bitrate 320k
```

Convert a folder to 24-bit FLAC:

```console
release\cli\CodecTone.Cli.exe "music\album" --format flac --sample-rate 48000 --bit-depth 24 --output-dir "exports" --suffix "_archive"
```

Cut a selection with one-second fades:

```console
release\cli\CodecTone.Cli.exe "music\track.flac" --format flac --start 14.06 --end 164.48 --fade-in 1 --fade-out 1 --suffix "_trimmed"
```

Compress a folder recursively with the high-fidelity profile:

```console
release\cli\CodecTone.Cli.exe "music\album" --format m4a --compress-profile high --recursive --output-dir "compressed"
```

Compress a folder toward a 500 MiB total budget:

```console
release\cli\CodecTone.Cli.exe "music\album" --format mp3 --target-total-mb 500 --recursive --optimize-artwork
```

Install the pinned managed FFmpeg build:

```console
release\cli\CodecTone.Cli.exe --install-ffmpeg
```

Run the tests without encoding audio:

```console
dotnet test AudioConverter.sln -c Release
```

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | file or folder | required | Selects a source file or folder. |
| `-f`, `--format` | `mp3`, `flac`, `wav`, `ogg`, `aac`, `m4a` | required | Selects the destination format. |
| `-o`, `--output-dir` | folder | operation-specific folder | Selects the destination folder. |
| `--suffix` | text | empty | Adds text before the destination extension. |
| `--bitrate` | rate | `192k` | Sets lossy conversion bitrate. |
| `--sample-rate` | integer Hz | source rate | Sets WAV or FLAC sample rate. |
| `--bit-depth` | `16`, `24`, `32` | encoder default | Sets WAV or FLAC bit depth. FLAC accepts 16 or 24. |
| `--start`, `--end` | seconds | full source | Selects a cut interval. |
| `--fade-in`, `--fade-out` | seconds | `0` | Applies fades inside the cut interval. |
| `--compress-profile` | `high`, `balanced`, `small` | disabled | Enables recursive profile-based compression. |
| `--target-total-mb` | number | disabled | Enables compression toward a total folder budget. |
| `--recursive` | flag | enabled in compression mode | Includes supported files in subfolders. |
| `--optimize-artwork` | flag | enabled in compression mode | Limits embedded cover art to 1200 pixels. |
| `--no-optimize-artwork` | flag | disabled | Preserves original cover-art dimensions. |
| `--overwrite` | flag | disabled | Replaces an existing destination file. |
| `--no-metadata` | flag | disabled | Removes metadata and cover-art mapping. |
| `--install-ffmpeg` | flag | disabled | Downloads and verifies the managed FFmpeg build. |

## Limitations

- Folder conversion does not scan nested folders. Compression does.
- Target-total-size mode is unavailable for lossless FLAC output.
- WAV, raw AAC, and OGG output do not receive embedded cover art.
- Metadata support depends on the source and destination containers.
- Preview supports Play and Stop, without pause or cursor scrubbing.
- A running FFmpeg operation cannot currently be cancelled from the GUI.
- Remix processes one song at a time and does not load VST plugins.
- Video conversion, web services, cloud storage, and telemetry are not implemented.
